## Description:
Some special items can drop only once a day. ESO has a server-dependent daily reset time at which such cooldowns are reset. This addon automatically records the time when you receive one of those items and supports you with helpful infromation. Item tooltips of the container display the cooldown information and a dialog will warn you if you try to open a container with active cooldown. Furthermore, you can check active cooldown times (basically the time until the daily server reset) via chat command "/ict" manually. The addon helps you to prevent opening containers or completing/hand in quests although you can not receive the valuable item/reward.
