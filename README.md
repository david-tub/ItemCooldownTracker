## Description:
Some special items have a 20 hours cooldown after looting and can be tracked with this addon. It automatically records the time when you receive the item. Item tooltips of the container display the cooldown information and a dialog will warn you if you try to open a container with active cooldown. Furthermore, you can check active cooldown times via chat command "/ict" manually. The addon helps you to prevent opening containers or completing/hand in quests although you can not receive the valuable item/reward.
